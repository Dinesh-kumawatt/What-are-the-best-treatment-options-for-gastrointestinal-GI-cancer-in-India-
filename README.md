Each type needs a specialized treatment plan based on the cancerâ€™s stage, location, and patientâ€™s overall health.

Surgery is often the first line of treatment, especially for early-stage cancers. The goal is to remove the tumor and surrounding tissue. In places like Care & Cure Hospital, Ahmedabad, GI surgeries are performed using both traditional and minimally invasive techniques for faster recovery.

Chemotherapy
This is used to kill cancer cells or shrink tumors before or after surgery. Some patients may receive oral or intravenous chemotherapy depending on the type and stage of GI cancer.

Radiation Therapy
Radiation is helpful for cancers like rectal or esophageal cancer. It can be combined with chemo (called chemoradiation) to increase success rates.

Targeted Therapy & Immunotherapy
Newer, more personalized treatments like targeted drugs and immunotherapy are also being offered in advanced cancer hospitals. These are usually recommended in specific cases where genetic testing of the tumor supports it.

Multidisciplinary Cancer Care
A good cancer hospital will not just focus on one treatment, but will use a team approach â€” involving oncologists, surgeons, radiologists, and dietitians â€” to build the best plan for each patient.
